title: A New Wordmark
---

<p class="big">I've begun to better define what Staydecent is and how
it acts as a studio—with a new understanding a new wordmark is
in order.</p>

### So, What is Staydecent?

I've described Staydecent simply as a portfolio website and as my
studio alias. More so, it's a registered business, and as a business
it offers Graphic Design & Web Development services. So what,
there are lots of web shoppes out there, how do I pitch mine? Well,
**Staydecent exists because I want to connect myself directly to the
work I want to do.** No office politics, no meetings, no hierarchy of
decision making, no packed lunches, just decent work. Staydecent was
created with this purpose in mind.

### Branding An Idea Rather Than Myself

Staydecent *was* a representation of me. And, I've always found it
**very** difficult to design for myself as I don't stick to any one
certain style or aesthetic. I always work with the same underlying
goals and principals, but I like to play with all the different styles
that I'm able to. **I find it very limiting to be defined by a certain
aesthetic or to be labeled.** Now, realising that Staydecent
represents a concept(or two) rather than me personally, I find it much
easier to apply a defined aesthetic.

### What Does Staydecent Represent?

Staydecent is a Web Design & Development studio focused on
simplicity and communication. Yes…But why the name? My
Grandmother used to tell my mom, before she went out for the evening,
"Bleibt gescheit!" Which has, for my purposes, been translated to
"Stay decent!" In regards to my business, it implies balance: Be
serious; Be effective; And, don't forget to have fun. It keeps me in
check.

### The New Wordmark

As well as a more defined wordmark, Staydecent will have a more
focused website. Less playground & experimentation. More
communication with potential clients. Stay tuned.
