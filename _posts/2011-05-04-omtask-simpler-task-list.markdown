title: Omtask, A Simpler Task List
---

<p class="big">Omtask is an omnibox task manager for people that want
to finish tasks, not organize them.</p>

### Why Omtask?

When I came across [Steve Losh's t](http://stevelosh.com/projects/t),
I loved the idea of it. But, I also realised the extent of my
*bashing* was updating git and svn repositories. Being mostly, a
front-end web developer—and addicted to the internet—I
spend a huge amount of time in my Web Browser, which happens to be
Chrome. *Hey, wait a minute! Aren't I able to run commands from
Chrome's address bar?* Yes! So, I set out to implement the exact same
feature set as `t` in a Google Chrome Extension.

*Not Quite There*

There is no marking tasks as *complete* and editing still needs to be
added. But, you can add tasks, view them, and delete them. All from
the Omnibar (this is what Chrome calls its address bar)!
But, this is enough functionality for me to already begin using it. I
stopped using [Task Thing](http://taskthing.appspot.com) awhile ago.

### It's So Easy!

`t Blog about omtask.`

There is no package yet, as I think it needs some more testing and
editing of tasks implemented. But, you can check out the source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/staydecent/omtask).
If you'd like to try it out right away, clone the repo, then on
Chrome's Extension page click *Developer Mode* and *Load unpacked
extension*.
