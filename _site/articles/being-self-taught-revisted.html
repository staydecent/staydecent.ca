    <p class='big'>A few weeks ago I posted about possible drawbacks of being a self-taught web developer and I got some really good feedback.</p>
<p>The two main problems I illustrated were: <strong>How to your asses your own ability and properly convey it</strong> and after assessing your ability <strong>how to properly determine the next step of progression.</strong> I now think both problems are futile. I&#8217;m self-taught because I didn&#8217;t agree with the requirements and structure of schools and assessments are inherently part of schooling&#8212;So, why am I trying to assess myself?</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t just tell people you are an expert; that&#8217;s for them to determine. Rather, show them what you do, and how it&#8217;s helped people in the past.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been asked for proof of my qualifications &#8212; my work speaks for itself and the majority of my new work comes from current, happy clients telling others about me.&#8221; &#8212; <a href='http://www.drawar.com/posts/The-Unforeseen-Consequence-of-Being-Self-Taught#comment-9047'>webecho</a></p>

<p>Being a self-taught web developer, I already know how to keep up with a radically evolving industry. Where as, graduating from a rigid web design program, you may assume you have reached a certain level of knowledge and skill that will maintain your elligibility in getting work. But, <strong>Regardless of a formal or informal educational background in this field, the technology will permeate anyones&#8217; experience and knowledge if they don&#8217;t constantly learn.</strong> Being self-taught, I&#8217;ve become a proactive learner: When I wanted to know how to create a webpage I scoured the internet for tutorials, guides, blog posts and spec sheets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;An earnest personal motivation to learn is not something you pick up in a structured learning environment, and this skill will help you stay on top of trends and developments in the field.&#8220; &#8212; <a href='http://www.drawar.com/posts/The-Unforeseen-Consequence-of-Being-Self-Taught#comment-9046'>eggNrice</a></p>

<p>However, being solely self-taught may not work for every field related to web design and develoment. When it comes to designers <a href='http://www.drawar.com/posts/The-Unforeseen-Consequence-of-Being-Self-Taught#comment-9072'>benek</a> argues:</p>
<q>&ldquo;[&hellip;] having formal education in design is huge if you&rsquo;re a designer. Most self-taught designers I see with little experience are just copying trendy tutorials online and they have no foundation in the principles of design.&rdquo;</q>
<p>Though, it&#8217;s very possible one could also teach themselves the fundamentals. I suppose it&#8217;s just more common place that purely self-taught designers often miss the foundation of good design.</p>

<p>In the end, the educational background of someone shouldn&#8217;t be the primary tell for their perceived ability. Your passion and hunger within your respective field guarantees much more. It&#8217;s actually pretty prevalant in the design and web industry that a your work outweighs your educational experience.</p>
