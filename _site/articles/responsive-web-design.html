    <p class='big'>The implementation and advocacy of responsive web
design is increasing, and possibly fully manifested in the web design
community. Are you taking part?</p>
<h3 id='what_is_responsive_design'>What Is Responsive Design?</h3>

<p>Responsive web design, basically means your website responds to different screen sizes. So, people browsing your site on a Smartphone, Tablet, Netbook or Desktop all get a usable (and hopefully similar, but not exact) experience.</p>

<h4 id='types_of_responses'>Types of Responses</h4>

<p>There are two main ways to respond to various screen sizes and devices, with: <em>responsive designs</em> or <em>adaptive designs</em>. Responsive design usually means a fluid grid, using percentages. See: <a href='http://stephencaver.com/'>Stephen Caver&#8217;s Portfolio</a> and <a href='http://www.miekd.com/'>Maykel Loomans&#8217; Blog</a>. And, adaptive design usually means you have fixed grid, that adapts (changes) depending on the screen size. See: <a href='http://colly.com/'>Mr. Simon Collison</a> and <a href='http://www.authenticjobs.com/'>Authentic Jobs</a>. You could also use a combination of both, sort of like my Blog that you’re reading now.</p>

<h3 id='media_queries'>Media Queries</h3>

<p>CSS3 media queries, quite literally, let you query different media types, <code>screen</code>, <code>print</code> and <code>handheld</code> as well as other helpful properties such as <code>min-width</code>, <code>max-width</code>, <code>orientation</code> and others. <strong>Media queries easily let you define your CSS for any screen size by querying the <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-width</code>.</strong> So, all you really need to know are the common screen widths. According to <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/bryanrieger/status/75597655870406656'>Bryan Rieger</a> the “major breakpoints are 0-320, 320-720, 720+ with minor breakpoints dependent on content and key devices (ie: 360, 480, 768, etc).”</p>

<h4 id='what_does_this_mean'>What Does This Mean?</h4>

<p>In the below snippet, I have included the exact media queries that I use, as well as a few (one, for now) examples from popular CSS frameworks and authors. <script src='https://gist.github.com/1021805.js?file=media_queries.css' /></p>

<p>So, if you’re like me and usually develop a new grid for each website you design (which, I highly recommend) those media queries are really helpful in adjusting your design for specific devices and screen widths. And, if you like using boilerplates/frameworks and often design a 960px grid, <a href='http://getskeleton.com'>Skeleton</a> is great.</p>

<h3 id='but_how_should_i_adjust_my_design_for_each_query'>But How Should I Adjust My Design For Each Query</h3>

<p>Obviously, you can’t just continuously shrink your column widths—eventually you’d have content trying to fit into 20px columns! So, commonly, you&#8217;ll end up dropping the number of columns. If you’re full-width design has 6 blocks floating together, you might have to drop that for each query: 4 blocks a row; 3 blocks a row; 2 blocks a row; everything in a single column.</p>

<h3 id='thats_it'>That’s It!</h3>

<p>Really. Responsive web design is not much work. I would say, for the bare minimum, design your full width site, Ipad width of 768px and mobile width of 320px.</p>
