<p class='big'>PHP is easily bashed, and rightfully so. But, after journeying with Python and tasting Ruby on Rails, I still find myself choosing PHP.</p>
<h3 id='whats_wrong_with_php'>What&#8217;s Wrong with PHP?</h3>

<p>PHP&#8217;s downfalls are pretty well documented, but let me quickly go over the points that affect me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bloated (?) syntax, especially compared to Python</li>

<li>Inconsistent function naming and parameter ordering</li>

<li>Lack of more powerful programming functions (Hooray for <strong>)</strong></li>

<li>PHP developers seem bent on holding PHP back</li>

<li>A plethora of badly written libraries and spaghetti code</li>

<li>Pretty separated community. Ruby and Python seem much more tight-nit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='whats_right_with_php'>What&#8217;s Right with PHP?</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s got to be something, right? Here&#8217;s what keeps me coming back:</p>

<p><strong>The best documentation.</strong> Yes Python&#8217;s is great but PHP&#8217;s is easier to search and scan, making it much quicker. Rails is very divided, and seemingly hidden. Though Rails for Zombies is awesome! My framework of choice also has the best documentation. It is informative, good for beginners yet still rather terse. With Django, I always feel like I need a printed version&#8230;because it&#8217;s wordy and some of the language isn&#8217;t straight-forward. <strong>Configuration is the big winner for me.</strong> There is next to no configuration when getting started with PHP and a framework. Being a Windows user, installation of Python libraries (or Django Packages) often produces errors. If I decide to switch back to Mac, I&#8217;ll probably use PHP less. <strong>PHP has so much to choose from.</strong> Django is great, but it&#8217;s often overkill for me. Flask and Bottle are buggy on my local machine and Pyramid is just a mess. I also prefer XDebug to Python&#8217;s Stack Trace.</p>

<h3 id='laravel_saved_php'>Laravel saved PHP</h3>

<p>Well, for me anyway. Laravel frees you from spaghetti code and allows you to write simple, expressive code. It has a little ways to go to compete with Rails or Django, but it&#8217;s growing fast. Laravel is <em>easily the best framework for PHP</em> and is an example of modern, proffessional programming done with PHP.</p>

<h3 id='a_brighter_future'>A Brighter Future?</h3>

<p>Despite my pessimism towards any positive progression with PHP, it seems like some very helpful changes are coming, including Array Dereferencing &#38; Array Literals!</p>

<p>I was planning to dive into Rails, with hopes of avoiding the gripes I had with Python/Django, but Laravel temporarily sidetracked me. I still plan on getting to know Rails, but not so immediately.</p>
