    <p class='big'>I've begun to better define what Staydecent is and how
it acts as a studio—with a new understanding a new wordmark is
in order.</p>
<h3 id='so_what_is_staydecent'>So, What is Staydecent?</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve described Staydecent simply as a portfolio website and as my studio alias. More so, it&#8217;s a registered business, and as a business it offers Graphic Design &amp; Web Development services. So what, there are lots of web shoppes out there, how do I pitch mine? Well, <strong>Staydecent exists because I want to connect myself directly to the work I want to do.</strong> No office politics, no meetings, no hierarchy of decision making, no packed lunches, just decent work. Staydecent was created with this purpose in mind.</p>

<h3 id='branding_an_idea_rather_than_myself'>Branding An Idea Rather Than Myself</h3>

<p>Staydecent <em>was</em> a representation of me. And, I&#8217;ve always found it <strong>very</strong> difficult to design for myself as I don&#8217;t stick to any one certain style or aesthetic. I always work with the same underlying goals and principals, but I like to play with all the different styles that I&#8217;m able to. <strong>I find it very limiting to be defined by a certain aesthetic or to be labeled.</strong> Now, realising that Staydecent represents a concept(or two) rather than me personally, I find it much easier to apply a defined aesthetic.</p>

<h3 id='what_does_staydecent_represent'>What Does Staydecent Represent?</h3>

<p>Staydecent is a Web Design &amp; Development studio focused on simplicity and communication. Yes…But why the name? My Grandmother used to tell my mom, before she went out for the evening, &#8220;Bleibt gescheit!&#8221; Which has, for my purposes, been translated to &#8220;Stay decent!&#8221; In regards to my business, it implies balance: Be serious; Be effective; And, don&#8217;t forget to have fun. It keeps me in check.</p>

<h3 id='the_new_wordmark'>The New Wordmark</h3>

<p>As well as a more defined wordmark, Staydecent will have a more focused website. Less playground &amp; experimentation. More communication with potential clients. Stay tuned.</p>
