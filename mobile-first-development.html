                    <p class="intro">Web Design means designing for a myriad of devices and screen resolutions. <em>Mobile First Development</em> results in the best experience for every device.</p>

                    <p>Firstly, when it comes to designing a website, I am not sure if you should be designing the <em>mobile</em> version or <em>desktop</em> version initially. Perhaps, it's an overlapping process. For me, the design process overlaps the development process, and the mobile and desktop processes overlap. So, all aspects affect each other.</p>

                    <p>But, when it comes to the front-end development, you should develop the mobile <em>friendly</em> version first.</p>

                    <h2>Here's Why</h2>

                    <p><em>Progressive Enhancement.</em> With the base CSS targeted for Mobile, you don't waste resources or bandwidth. Using Media Queries for larger screens, you can layer on CSS rules keeping the base as light as possible.</p>

                    <h3>But, what about images and media?</h3>

                    <p>There's a few solutions. This website uses simple jQuery checks for specific screen resolutions, replacing mobile-friendly images with higher resolution ones.</p>

                    <p>My <a href="fork">fork</a> of Jon Smith's Gridless Boilerplate allows for a Mobile First development process, just using Media Queries and very basic JavaScript statements. It's really easy to get started with this approach.</p>

                    <p>Designing websites means you need to consider many devices and screen sizes. Otherwise, you are failing as a web designer. Mobile First development is the best approach so you don't unnecessarily waste mobile users' bandwidth. <em>Mobile First</em> is just <em>Progressive Enhancement</em> emphasizing mobile-device compatibility.</p>
