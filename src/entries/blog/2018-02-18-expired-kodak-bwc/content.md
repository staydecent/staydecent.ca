title: Expired Kodak BWC
---

I've been getting more and more into shooting 35mm film these past few months. So much so, that I'm starting to head out and only bring my film SLR, leaving my Sony NEX 6 behind.

Recently, Angela found a bunch of rolls she bought maybe 15 years ago. I've now shot two of them, compensating for their expiration by dropping the ISO on the camera down a stop. For this roll of Kodak BWC, I could have stopped down another stop &endash; quite a few photos were underexposed.

All shot on a Yashica FX-D, with a 28mm or 50mm lens.

Apologies for the crummy scans. Working on that...
