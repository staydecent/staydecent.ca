title: Secularisation and the Loss of Morality
excerpt: Democracy and Science are amoral. So morality is left to the people. In liberal democracy, it's left to the individual. Without a higher source of morality (God), do we actual lose morality as a people?

Democracy and Science are amoral. So morality is left to the people. In liberal democracy, it's left to the individual. Without a higher source of morality (God), do we lose morality as a people?

With this lack of a communal moral compass, we are left with "The Rule of Law" which people grasp onto. But, our laws are not necessaily moral, so abiding without lenience creeps into Authoritarianism.
