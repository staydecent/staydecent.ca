title: 2022: Year in Review
---

Well, I didn't blog for a whole year. My last post was a [reflection on 2021](/blog/2021-year-in-review) where I left off saying "For now, I‚Äôm still feeling introspective and perhaps in waiting. For what, I can‚Äôt say‚Äîthough I have some ideas. Yet, I sense a new beginning in 2022." So, let's start there!

Indeed, that introspection continued in what I guess I would call my path towards spirituality. I struggle to share with people that I'm now a "spiritual person" or "on the spiritual path" without sounding like a dork. Oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. This has mostly been guided by books, podcasts, and the wisdom of [my partner](http://hapaway.com/).

As for the new beginning: my partner and I sold our house and moved to a new town! This decision was largely guided by intuition and spiritual guidance rather than reason, which has resulted in a jolt of exuberance in both of our lives. There seem to be certain moments, at least in my life, where a life decision presents itself with two main paths: the first being one of reason and rationality, which garners support by friends, family, and even society at large; the other is one that eschews reason, yet pulls on you despite all the reason you throw at it. When debating internally, you often refer to the reasonable option as the one you "should" choose. The other option is the one you "want" for seemingly inexplicable reasons. In my experience, following the second path consistently leads to unknown outcomes that exceed whatever I could have dreamed of.

Otherwise, world events and other external matters played a smaller role for me in the last year. I have forgone social media and news in favor of the aforementioned spiritual and personal growth. Which, I believe, allows me to remain open and compassionate regardless of the situation at hand. 

## Some Favourites from 2022

I plan to share a bit of an outlook on 2023 in a future post. To wrap up 2022, I wanted to reflect on some memorable books, podcasts, videos, and other _content_ that stood out to me.

### Books

I don't really rate books. If I finish a book, then I'd give it a 4 or 5 stars. Anything less, and I wouldn't have finished the book. So, any book I finish is a book I would highly recommend!

#### Alan Watts - Out of Your Mind

<small><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781622037520" taget=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>ISBN-13: 9781622037520</a></small>

Some of Alan Watts most revered lectures compiled into a book by his Son. An enjoyable introduction to Watts and some tenets of Buddhism from his perspective.

#### Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche - In Love with the World

<small><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780525512547" taget=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>ISBN-13: 9780525512547</a></small>

Interesting to learn about the early life of someone who grew up in Tibetan Buddhism from birth and the eventual wandering meditation they took on that nearly led to their death.

#### Kathleen Riordan Speeth - The Gurdjieff Work

<small><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780874774924" taget=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>ISBN-13: 9780874774924</a></small>

Ah, the "rascal sage" who was perhaps one of the first people to integrate "Eastern" and "Westen" wisdom for European and American _seekers_. _The Work_ is an interesting system with many aspects applicable in our modern times. Fun, yet heavy reading.


#### Carlos Castaneda - The Second Ring of Power

<small><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780671732479" taget=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>ISBN-13: 9780671732479</a></small>

Really, I recommend the whole Don Juan series by Carlos Castaneda. I think I've read nine of the eleven books he wrote on the teachings of Don Juan. The teachings are quite esoteric, and would likely require a lifetime dedication to fully integrate. While all of the books are interesting in their own right, I'd say The Second Ring of Power had the most gripping tale.


#### Ch√∂gyam Trungpa - Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism

<small><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781570629570" taget=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>ISBN-13: 9781570629570</a></small>

For anyone interested in spirituality, I'd recommend this as a must-read. Compiled from lectures that Ch√∂gyam Trungpa gave in the 1970s, advising on how the spiritual path, if jumped into naively, can actually reinforce the ego leading to a hardened egocentricity. 


### Podcasts

I don't really listen to podcasts. Haha, however, when my partner are in the car for extended periods of time, we often throw on a podcast episode or two. This last year, [Here and Now](https://www.ramdass.org/teachings/?fwp_format=podcast) by Ram Dass has been consistently good.


### Skateboard Videos

After taking a decade away from skateboarding, I've been getting back into it over the last few years, with 2022 being the heaviest yet. That said, there is just way too much skateboard content to keep up -- and I'm not even on the 'gram! Anyway, here are some fav videos I bookmarked.

- [WKND - BOTTLE NECK SEWAGE](https://youtu.be/iYu0bUyeMO0)
- [Skateboarding X Rollerblading](https://youtu.be/Yi0ERENViF4)
- [Element Skateboards "E.S.P. VOL.2" Video](https://youtu.be/6yDSHC0EPyc)
- [Deedz' "HVVS" Part](https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/deedz-hvvs-part/)
- [Tyshawn Jones‚Äô ‚ÄúThe General‚Äù Hardies Part](https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/tyshawn-jones-the-general-hardies-part/)
- [Zero Introduces Kairi Netsuke](https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/zero-introduces-kairi-netsuke/)

- [SOLO: Vincent Milou's "You Changed" video part](https://youtu.be/1avzYu_paZA)


### Movies

For context, I generally limit my movie watching to action-comedies and romcoms.

- [Triangle of Sadness](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/triangle_of_sadness): Can I actually recommend this movie? I don't really know. It was entertaining. It was horrendous. I walked away with a empty pit of despair in my stomach.
- [Bullet Train](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bullet_train_2022): Some people seem to dislike the premise of the story. I thought it was hilarious.
- [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/everything_everywhere_all_at_once): I mean, come on.
- [The Lost City](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lost_city): Good ol' Holywood entertainment here.
- [Bodies Bodies Bodies](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bodies_bodies_bodies): I laughed.
- [Confess, Fletch](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/confess_fletch): Other than action-comedies and romcoms, I also enjoy comedy/mystery movies.
- [Vengeance](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vengeance_2022): Was it a good year for comedies or something?!


### YouTube Channels

lol, why not.

- [Dianxi Xiaoge](https://www.youtube.com/@dianxixiaoge): Peaceful and beautiful channel about food from a small town in Yunnan, China.
- [Kurt Caz](https://www.youtube.com/@KurtCaz): If "Gonzo Travel YouTuber" is a thing, I'd venture Kurt embodies that perfectly.
- [Gas Giants](https://www.youtube.com/@gasgiants2028): Best "Skating with Friends" type YT channel out there.

Okay, I'm bored if this. Happy new year!
