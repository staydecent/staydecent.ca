title: 2023: Year in Review
---

Beat my record set [last year](/blog/2022-year-in-review) and didn't blog even once this year! I'm writing this and it's already 2024. Well, I  have no idea what's going to come out for this review, so let's find out together.

It's been a weird year. At times, I've felt I've had the most clarity and other times, complete confusion. Pondering how to encapsulate the year, I keep coming back to how grateful I am to live every day with my [best friend](https://hapaway.com) in the WHOLE world. I feel so lucky to have a partner who shares the desire to experiment with life together&hellip;

Standing here at my desk, trying to reflect, looking through photos and notes from the year, all I can think of is gratitude for Angela. So, thanks Angela! I'm currently on Sabbatical, honing in on what I want to do and how I can be of service. And, really, all I care about is that I get to spend as many of the coming years as I can with my best friend.
