title: 2024: Year in Review
---

Or, the year of the sabbatical. 

Previous Years in Review: [2023](https://staydecent.ca/blog/2023-year-in-review/), [2022](https://staydecent.ca/blog/2022-year-in-review/), [2021](https://staydecent.ca/blog/2021-year-in-review/)

What did I even do for my sabbatical? Well I quit my job for one—well that was in 2023. Then I didn’t really do anything. Of course, I could have gone on some grand adventure. Travelled the world. Gone on a pilgrimage. But I did not. 

I think that was the point. Not doing anything. It was in the not-doing that my body, nervous system, my cells got a chance to stabilize. To find some homeostasis. 

It was tough at times. I really didn’t know if I could back to programming or any tech job again. 

Reflecting now it’s wild to me how different I am now. And I’m not being cliche or glib. I really had so much of my identity tied up in my job. And not like “ima programmer!” And being all proud. Rather the reality that I was spending the vast majority or my time and energy on work. That I left little to no energy for anything outstde of work. 

It’s obvious now that it lead to burnout. But at the time it’s like I had blinders on. 

Anyway. What a trip it is to shift from a “doing” to a “being”. 

I really don’t know what I’m doing. I feel I’m slowly coming out of my sabbatical. Yet I don’t have a clear direction or vision of where I’m going or what I’m doing. Energetically it feels like I’m shifting out of the reset that my sabbatical was/is and moving into just a new way of being. A new modus operandi. The doing will follow naturally from the being. 

Other than that, I biked, I skateboarded, I read. My partner and I roadtripped through Oregon and Washington coasts. 

**Looking forward**

I see 2025 as another year of re-balancing, resting, and recalibrating. A transition towards 2026 which will likely contain more action and direction.

We'll see.
