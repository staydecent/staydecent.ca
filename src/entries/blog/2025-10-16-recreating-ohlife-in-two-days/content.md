title: Recreating OhLife in two days
---

Many moons ago, there was a lovely service called [OhLife](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ohlife) which has been shutdown for some time now. Recently, I've been missing it as a simple way to journal and relive past entries. So, I recreated it in two days using AI—and what do the kids call it? Vibe coding?

When I say two days, I really mean two sessions of sitting down at my computer for maybe an hour or two. Which is quite remarkable. I mean, the concept of OhLife isn't too complicated, but still, pretty cool.

Of course, scheduling an automated email to remind you to journal is not really a feature at all. That could be done in something like five minutes. The real draw of OhLife was that it collected all the entries and randomly reminded you about them. Basically, you'd get a daily email that said:

> How'd you day go?
> Two weeks ago* you wrote: ...

That two weeks ago was sometimes a different interval—four days ago, one year ago, three months etc.
