title: Minor Update to Task Thing
---

While remaining rather minimal, Task Thing has a new feature—more specifically a helpful piece of data is now displayed on completed tasks.

For anyone who is unaware, I created a little app called [Task
Thing](http://taskthing.appspot.com) a [few months
ago](http://blog.staydecent.ca/entry/task-thing). It hasn't gained
much traction, but a couple people seem to be using it(Woo-ee!).

With the hope that I will be more efficient and precise at tracking my
time, **Task Thing now tells you how long it took for you to complete a
task**. This functionality was already implemented as Task Thing logs
the creation date and last modified date for each task. Using this
data, when a task is marked as completed(which logs the time of this
action) Task Thing displays that time relative to the time since
creation.

Because I use Task Thing at a very micro scale—I only add tasks
that I am tackling that day, and usually as I begin working on
them—I can actually reference this *time to complete* when
logging my hours for the day. Obviously, if I create a task one day,
ignore it for a few days, then work on it, and mark it complete, it's
not an accurate measure of **actual time** committed to that task.
But, still an interesting piece of data. Maybe I should start logging
average time to complete tasks?
