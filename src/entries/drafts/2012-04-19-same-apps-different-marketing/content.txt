title: Growing Food is Complex
---

<p class="big">The food industry may be the largest, most complex and currupted industry we have. And, without an improved food culture, we're at risk of net negative environmental, social and even ethical impacts on humanity.</p>

The only way to target these negative impacts is by education and awareness. Which, I hope to accomplish&mdash;even just slightly&mdash;by writing this first post in a series of two. First up, I'll be covering the growing of food. 

If you're wondering why you should listen to a web developer when it comes to the food industry. All I can say is this: my life is *mostly* centered around food culture. And, most of my knowledge and experience should be accredited to my girlfriend&mdash;who doesn't blog, yet! Briefly: we live on a farm; we want to own a farm; she cooks great food; I like to eat said food; we care about the well-being of all humans.

## Large, complex and currupted

Aprox. 7 billion mouths to feed. That's large. 

And, with that large number, comes unmistakable complexity. Unfavourable growing conditions, dessertification, erosion, limited water sources, exploited labour, food trends, globalization, fossil fuels, education (lack of), pollution, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbacides, genetically-modified organisms&hellip;Damn! A seemingly endless number of choices when it comes to growing food for a group of people.

Like any industry&mdash;especially one of this size&mdash;curruption can be found. No person should be able to make a fortune off of food. Food is not a commodity. It is a right and freedom for all people in every part of the world. And, until the majority of us start treating food this way, there will always be someone exploiting the land and people (and government subsidies!) for personal financial gain.

## Conventional Farming

What the western world calls *conventional* farming, which is the most wide-spread and responsible for the majority of your supermarket foods, is a practice that requires a large amount of fossil fuels through petroleum-based chemical fertilizers, pesticides and farm machinery. Western agriculture relies *very* heavily on fossil fuels. And, that's before we even consider transporting. 

Negative impacts of conventional farming:
monocultures, degradation, cheap labour, trucking, shipping, posiounous, food waste, packaging, etc.

The positives arguments are empty
High-yields of low-nutrition, empty calories is not a good thing. the amount of food waste of this conventional food producing and shipping may exceed the increased yields. Risk risk risk, of crop failure.

## Alternatives

Right off the bat, there will be some people who lay the claim that an alternative is alternative because it's a lesser option than what's conventional. I don't know about other industries, but I can assure you in food that is not the case. *Alternative* farming methods are alternative for a few reasons:

1. No single person or company is going to make a fortune via these practices.
2. What's different is scary.

Whoa, that's actually pretty simple! Let's learn about a couple alternatives:

### Organic Farming

The Canadian Government puts it well:

> Organic production is a holistic system designed to optimize the productivity and fitness of diverse communities within the agro-ecosystem, including soil organisms, plants, livestock and people. The principal goal of organic production is to develop enterprises that are sustainable and harmonious with the environment.

I highly recommend reading the standards. But summarized highlights:

- The use of non-organic, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides is not alowed. Refer to the [permitted substances list](http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ongc-cgsb/programme-program/norms-standards/internet/bio-org/permises-permitted-eng.html).
- Instead, crop-rotation, compost and tilling is used to [maintain soil fertility](http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ongc-cgsb/programme-program/norms-standards/internet/bio-org/principes-principles-eng.html#a064).
- And weeds and pests are managed by creating a balanced ecosystem via rotation, resistent plant varities, trap crops (crops that attract pests away from another), crops that repel pests, grazing or manual weeding.
