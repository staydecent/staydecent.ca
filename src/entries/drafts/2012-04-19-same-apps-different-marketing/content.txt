title: Same Apps, Different Marketing
---

<p class="big">I recently came across two apps whose core products seemed almost identical, while the marketing was drastically different. Let's take a look!</p>

## Same apps

[Dropmark](//dropmark.com/?ref=staydecent) and [Gimmebar](//gimmebar.com/) both start by saving content from the web. A JavaScript bookmarklet pops open a frame, where you can drag recognizable media from the page. Both, Dropmark and Gimmebar, have private and public *collections*. And, it appears you can have as many collections as you wish.

The apps do differ at a closer look: Dropmark can integrate with some desktop apps, and Gimmebar has more organizational features.

## Different marketing

So, hopefully we agree that these apps are pretty darn similar. But, what's *fascinating* is how different their copy is. Dropmark's homepage:

> Dead simple collaboration in the cloud.

And Gimmebar's:

> Save the Web

I'm no copywriter, but there is a *huge* difference here. Gimmebar talks directly about their product and its' features. Dropmark talks about its' targeted user&mdash;They use an interactive slider to showoff the features.

After getting passed my initial confusion, Dropmark's slick homepage and targeted copy got me excited about, well, collaborating with clients!

### Let's looks at Gimmebar's copy

I consider pricing as part of a products marketing&mdash;at least for this blog post&mdash;so let's talk about pricing! Both Gimmebar and Dropmark have *pro accounts*. Dropmark offers increased storage (25gb up from 1gb) for $4/month, seems like a good deal. With Gimmebar, you don't get anything in terms of increased storage. Well, not yet at least. Again, Gimme's snarky copy tells us:

> Want to look cool but donâ€™t have access to sunglasses or a popped collar? Why not try our pro badge on for size. Yeah, that looks nice.

You also get a *first-look* at new features and *Mystery Love*. Oh yeah, and that's $2/month.

What's the take-away?

Fuck, no idea. Perhaps, highlights the importance of marketing. Specifically copywriting. Gimmebar being light-hearted, snarky, perhaps silly. But, service is serious. Dropmark talks in direct, business way: they speak to *productive people and teams*.

In any case, both Dropmark and Gimmebar are worthwhile apps. I personally stuck with Gimmebar as it has more organizational prowess.
