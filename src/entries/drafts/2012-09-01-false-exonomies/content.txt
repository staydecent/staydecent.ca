title: Well-Functioning Ecosystems
---

<p class="big">Jon Chiu, a documentary film-maker, has dedicated his life spreading the knowledge and successes of rejuvinating deserts back to well-functioning ecosystems.</p>

The results of the projects he covers are astounding. People in Africa, China, India and elsewhere have turned baron, dry, desert-like landscapes back into lush, hydrated, functioning ecosystems. These rejuvenated lands, bring back native species of plants (and even leopards in the case of Kenya), as well as open the door to growing foods to *sustain*[1] local communities.

Interesting, as most of these baron lands were, at some point, fertile and used for agriculture. Through unsustainable practices&mdash;mainly mismanaged water and over-grazing by livestock&mdash;these lands were devasted.

Jon Chiu's documentaries contain a wealth of information, but I'd like to highlight three impactful points.

## First, Learn from the past mistakes of Agriculture

Like always, we can learn much from the past. Look at places like Jordan, Ethiopa and China. In each of these places, humans have lived for thousands of years. We can directly see the impact of poort agricultural practices on the land. And, how it negatively affects communities today.

It's also important to note: The majority of today's agricultural practices are worse than those in the past[2]. We can postulate that this will result in unfertile lands quicker than it has in the past. As well, with a larger population, the effects are more widespread.

## Second, Desertified lands can be brought back to life

Hearing about droughts, polution, starvation etc. one can feel hopeless. Have hope! Jon Chiu has documented, what has been in my opinion, the most profound success humans have achieved in regards to ecosytems: **Desertified lands can be brought back to lush, fertile, food-bearing, functioning ecosystems!** If this does not astound you. Just repeat it in your head for a few hours.

Even more astounding, the proven technique does not require modern agricultural technologies! So succintly summarized by [guy's name from china]:

Once restored, fertile lands can sustain[1] food for local communitues, presently and for future generations, by following permaculture practices.

## Third, Economies should be based on well-functioning Ecosystems

Finally, I can chorently explain why Canada's current economic stability makes me uncomfortable. Canada's economy, like many others, puts monetary value on the goods and services that *rely* on a well-functioning ecosystem. If an ecosystem shows signs of degradation or unstability, this does not immediatly affect the econmies based on it. Only, once you reach a breaking point, and things collapse, do the economies reflect reality.

Jon makes the argument that economies should be based on the ecosystems that feed the goods and services. This way, ecosystems could not be exploited (and depleted) for short but large monetary gains. Of course, this requires people
