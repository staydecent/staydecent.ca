Initially, Cook It Local was described just as a seasonal recipe reminder. You can input a recipe, and the website would analyze the list of ingredients and determine the most seasonally appropriate time to cook the recipe. From there, my girlfriend and I have been constantly brainstorming how to make the site more useful and we have lots planned for the near future!
