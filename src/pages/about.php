      <p>You got this gist on the homepage, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to what else you need to know&hellip;</p>

      <p>Hmmm, what else? I started skateboarding when I was like 12 or 14. Gave it up in my twenties and took it back up a few years ago—still got a few basics down!</p>

      <p>Oh! I <em>love</em> bicycles. I honestly have a bit of guilt around the fact that I own <em>five</em> bikes. But, that's just a psychological knot that I'm working on untying—the guilt, not the bikes!</p>
      <p>There's nothing quite like riding a bike on good trail. I like bikes so much I'm going to tell you more about them.</p>
      <p>Most recently, I got my first full-suspension mountain bike. Wowee. It's a Kona Process 134 DL. It's perfect. I also have a 2018 Chromag Wideangle. It's a hardtail, which means it's only squishy at the fork. That was my primary mountain until this year. Not sure what's going to come of it now.</p>
      <p>I learned how to ride a bike as a kid, but really don't have any memories of it. It didn't take and for most of my childhood I didn't have a bike.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of my sabbatical, I built up my first road-style bike. It fits (and currently has) 2.2" tires, so it's not <em>really</em> a road bike I guess. But, it's got a level top-tube and so, ya know, aesthetics. Also it's sparkly lilac and the tires are red and the griptape is green and it's got nice shiny silver parts. What a treat.</p>
      <p>I also have a single speed e-bike with front and rear baskets for hauling veggies and mail and whatever.</p>
      <p>Finally, I have the Junco. It's really a one of a kind. Literally. It was handbuilt by Tyler at <a href="https://huckleberryhandmadebikes.ca/" target=_blank>Huckleberry Handmade</a>. It's a real long bike with a short rear end, 700c wheels, with old Surly dropouts, currently setup single speed. It rips. It likes to sprint, even if it has super swept back alt-bars.</p>

      <p><em>Shit.</em> You're still reading?!</p>

      <p>Uh, I dunno, I'm writing this on an OG gray Microsoft Surface laptop, only it's running Debian with a custom Surface kernel and Cinnamon as the desktop environment. I'm <em>quite</em> fond of it.</p>
      <p>Also on my sabbatical, I built up my first computer from scratch. I should write a blog post about that&hellip;</p>
      <p>I have an iPhone. It's pretty sweet. But the OG Google Pixel is still the best phone camera I've experienced—that thing was perfect. Instant loading, amazing contrast and auto white balance. I still laugh how bad iPhone is at capturing the overload of greens of the Pacific Northwest. Like, do they not test the camera outside of California?</p>

      <p>Finally, I'm in a constant bafflement at the absurdity of our existence. There's just so much space <em>out there</em> and, as far as we know, nothing is as abundantly alive as Earth. Pff. Wow. What a fucking gift.</p>
