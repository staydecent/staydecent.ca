    <p>I try to keep a <a href="http://staydecent.ca/code" title="Blog posts about programming and app development">blog</a> about app development and technical things I learn. I also, infrequently, share <a href="http://staydecent.ca/blog">stories and opinions</a> on whatever’s piqued my interest.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy food, nature and exploring new places. I also <em>really</em> enjoy taking <a href="/photography">photos</a> of those experiences.</p>
    <p>See what I&rsquo;m <a href="http://staydecent.ca/now" title="Currenly, since I have moved every year for the past 8 years.">doing now</a>.</p>
