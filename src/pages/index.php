        <p>This is my [Digital Garden](/what-is-a-digital-garden) where I aim to share my _unpolished_ perspective. Unpolished really just means that nothing is "done" on this website. Everything published is ephemeral (in spirit, I don't plan to delete much of anything), with the aim that my perspective changes and grows. The difference between a digital garden and a personal blog may seem subtle. Yet, for me, it's the key detail that frees myself to actually publish and update this website again—you may notice the [archive]() is quite limited and filled with rather infrequent posts.</p>

        <p>Personal blogs used to share the same _unfinished_ and rough draft vibe as a Digital Garden. With the onset of Twitter, unpolished ideas moved over there. And, for me, my perspective of personal blogs become more rigid: they were where the polished, edited ideas went after exploring them on Twitter. Since [leaving social media]() I haven't shared any photos or words on the internet. It's been so long, that I've even developed a limiting belief of "who am I to publish something?" I have to remind myself of the immense value and joy I get from others who share personal perspectives on the internet. I don't aim to be an authority on anything. Yet, perhaps, someone will still find joy—or even inspiration—by exploring this garden.</p>

        <p>So, that's the context around this website. It's still in it's early stages of becoming a [Digital Garden](), but the intention is here. There are no analytics or tracking. I have no idea if anyone still finds this site. In case anyone does, feel free to [reach out to me here]().</p>
