      <p>Hi there, I’m Adrian Unger, a software developer who prefers to be outdoors. I have a particular fondness for rocky coastlines and mountain meadows.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>I actively enjoy food, nature and exploring new places. I also <em>really</em> enjoy taking <a href="http://staydecent.ca/photography/">photos</a> of those experiences.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>See what I’m doing <a title="Currenly, since I have moved every year for the past 8 years." href="http://staydecent.ca/now/">right now</a>.</p>
