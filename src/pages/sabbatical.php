        <p class=bigger>Having the luxury to take a sabbatical is a wonderful thing.</p>
        <p>For me, I reached a point where it was clear I wasn't really following my heart when it came to my vocation. I actually have had the luck of having a wonderful career working with even more wonderful people. Despite this, I still would reach a place where I felt stuck, unfulfilled, and would create my own tension and stories to explain why the job was not for me anymore. Only with my most recent job did I recognize that it was all my own creation. It forced me to really look at my conditioned and unconscious behavior. Thus, the sabbatical.</p>
        <p>I can't say anything truly new or profound has come of my time to think and process. Really, it seems most if not all of life's problems have been answered in some way by philosophers and spiritual teachers of the past. In any case, there are a few quips and viewpoints that exemplify the experience I've had. I aim to collect them here and update this as my views change and experience continues to unfold.</p>
