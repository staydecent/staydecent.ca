      <p>What the heck do I call what I'm doing? What the heck even <em>is</em> Spiritual Alchemy? Well, spirituality can be a bit of a loaded term. At it's simplest, to me, it points to our inner realm — that subjective place that houses our experiences, perspectives and identity. Of course, we could just call that the psyche. I suppose spirituality is really that inner psychological drive for meaning, connection and purpose. </p>
      <p>Alchemy is about transformation. It's about turning "lead" into "gold" which is really an analogy for turning your "base" nature into higher expression. It's about intergrating your various, sometimes conflicting, psychological needs.</p>
      <p>Together, Spiritual Alchemy simply points to self-discovery and an integrative approach to cultivating wholeness, meaning and purpose.</p>
      <p>Oh shit, what does "integrative" mean?? It means we don't reject or deny or judge our own Self and our behavior and desires and drives. We welcome all of our Self and through openness and compassion we integrate all aspects of our Self into wholeness.</p>
      <p>Why do this? 'Cause you want to! Not everyone cares to dive deep into their own being and nature. Some do. I went full in after burning out from my Software Engineering career. I feel I've gone deep and found the nooks and crannies and gotcha's and can act as a guide and facilitor to those who also wish to dive deep into their own being.</p>
