      <p>I&#39;ve decided to call myself a <em>Spiritual Alchemist</em> and <em>Consciousness Wizard</em>. Pretty sick if you ask me — but what the heck do they mean? And, why two titles rather than one? Great questions, friends.</p>
      <p>Well, they&#39;re two sides of the same coin. And, what coin is that? Let&#39;s break down Spiritual Alchemist first.</p>
      <p>Spiritual and spiirituality refer to our inner realms, our subjective experience and psyche, and point toward our inner drive for meaning, connection and purpose. Alchemy simply means to transform or even transmute — to intregrate and make whole.</p>
      <p>Thus, Spiritual Alchemy is the act of integrating our various aspects (wants, needs, desires, beliefs, identities) into wholeness. It&#39;s about transforming seemingly opposing forces into a cohesive unity.</p>
      <p>Now, when you think of an Alchemist, what comes to mind? Perhaps a, sort-of, mad scientist toiling away in his occult labratory? An old wooden table covered in vials and pipets and old tomes as he struggles to turn lead into gold — to fashion the Philsopher&#39;s Stone and immortaltiy?</p>
      <p>And, now a Wizard? Where does he fit? Not in a labratory. Perhaps he just appears in a dark forest? Or on the precipice of a daring cliff overlooking vast lands? He&#39;s not toiling. He exerts almost no effort — much like Albus Dumbledore. Cool, calm, collected; waiting for the right moment and the right action to make itself known.</p>
      <p>In this configuration, the Alchemist is the action-oriented, masculine aspect of transformation and magick. He is willful, focused and knows how to perservere. While still a male title, the Wizard is the feminine, receptive aspect of transformation and magick. He knows how to wait, listen and recieve.</p>
      <p>Spirituality and Consciousness go hand-in-hand, being nearly identical — though, with subtle differences. In both cases, the Alchemist and Wizard point to transformation, integration and unification. The Alchemist representing the willful masculine and the Wizard representing the receptive feminine. They harmonize eachother.</p>
      <p>Together, they represent two universal forces and two fundemental approaches to transformation.</p>
