      <p>The pandemic kicked off what would be the <a href="https://tednet.org/newsletter/how-i-became-an-ascended-master/" target="_blank" title="How I became an ascended master">shattering of my worldview</a>&mdash;one based purely on logic and reason and rationality and the delusion that that was enough to understand the world. The only way for me to even realise this and become conscious of it was to start writing, without for which I was nearly as unaware of my own internal state as that of another.</p>
      <p>Journaling is good. Sometimes I just need to get some emotion out through that process. Yet, as I was still wrestling with losing the security of my worldview, I found countless worldviews of others that offered a sort of temporary refrain. It was easy to fall into the comfort of someone else's creation, of someone else's story.</p>
      <p>By writing out this process <a href="https://tednet.org" target="_blank" title="The Existential Detective Network">publically</a>, it forced me to be more discerning. It's easy to write for one's self, in private, and have no stake and thus fall into any whim or fantasy.</p>
      <p>I also take great pleasure in reading other people's personal blogs and explorations. Hopefully, I can add to that.</p>
